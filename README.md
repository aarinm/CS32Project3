# CS32Project3

This project was created and finished in February 2019 as part of an assignment for CS 32, or Introduction to Computer Science II, at UCLA. 
This repo contains the C++ files of all the code for this project, asset files needed for it to run properly, an Xcode project file, and a report that details the class structure I conceptualized as well as all the functions I implemented.
